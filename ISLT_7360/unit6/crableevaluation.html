    <h1>Cynthia Crable's Pilot Website Evaluation Report</h1>
    <h2>Participants:</h2>
    <p>Michael Haferkamp is my neighbor who has 3 girls who attend a high school in the area. asked him to take my survey because he would be similar to a parent that I would have during the school year. Michael is an electrician in his mid-50’s who has basic knowledge of computers and the internet. He used a Dell Inspirion with Windows 10 and Firefox as the browser. I asked Michael to look at my website from the view of what a parent might be looking for in a website of a teacher. This was helpful since he does not have coding background but could give me great feedback about how beneficial my website will be for my parents.</p>
    <p>Maggie Moore is a fellow teacher within my district. Maggie is in her mid-20s and has her bachelor’s degree in FACS education from UCM. She is also currently pursuing her Master’s Degree from UCM in Curriculum and Instruction. She also teaches FACS and teaches similar classes as I do. She is a great person to have critique my website since she is familiar with the content area and can help me figure out what I need to include or exclude on my website. Maggie used a Toshiba Satellite computer with the browser being Mozilla Firefox on her home Wi-Fi. </p>
    <p>Dorothy Schneider is also a peer teacher in her early 30’s. She has her bachelor’s degree in Middle School English literature from Lindenwood University.  She does not teach my content area but is familiar with the internet and websites. I chose her for similar reasons as I did Maggie to review my website. Although she does not teach FACS I felt like her background as an English teacher is helpful when looking at nuts and bolts of the actual content on the website. She used an HP computer running on Windows 7. Her web browser was Microsoft edge and she used her home charter Wi-Fi to view the website. </p>

 <p>Everyone seemed to agree that the website was easy to navigate and was for the most part visually pleasing. Michael suggested that my website needed more added to it to “spruce it up” and Maggie thought that the website was heavy to the left side. I agree with these statements and I feel like they are valid and will be corrected for the final version of my website. Dorothy also suggested adding in more pictures into my website to make it more visually pleasing. </p>
 <p>I had the highest scores in the content area of my website. Everyone seemed to think that there was enough information for the audience in the website and all of my links to my attachments such as syllabi, supply lists, and YouTube videos worked quickly and were easy to find</p>
 <p>Maggie thought that I needed list my email since it was just linked to my name at the bottom of the page. Her and Dorohty both suggested looking over my grammar and spelling in my website, although Maggie specifically drew my attention to the "About Me" section. Michael suggested that my documents and other content have a specific updated last section that way they know when the attachments were for.  </p>

 <h2>Use Cases:</h2>
 <p>I think that based on the feedback from my surveys two out of the three use cases were met. The one that was not met was the calendar for everyone to get information from about due dates, sewing lab dates, etc. I explained this in my comments when I turned in my pilot website I have not added that in just yet. I am working on getting that incorporated into the website so that everyone can be updated about the major events happening in my classroom. There was sufficent information about each class added so it was easy to check off all but one of my use cases.</p>
<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes:</h2>
 <p>Based on the feedback that I have collected, I plan on changes these areas:</p>
 <h3>Navigation</h3>
 <p>I plan on making the navigation bigger and putting it under my website banner. This will make it easier to see and more visually pleasing. I also want to center the pages in the navigation bar. This will help with the website favoring the left side more than the rest of the page.</p>
 <h3>Pictures/Content</h3>
 <p>I want to add in more pictures of things we have completed in class to showcase my students talents. That was one of the bigger suggestions was to add in more pictures to help make the website look more personable and relateable.</p>
 <h2>Reflections on Evaluation Process:</h2>
 <p>I found this process very helpful. I was able to get useful feedback from people that would use my website before finishing it to help me hone in and fine tune the website. When I look at my website after so many hours it can be hard to catch the finer details and having someone look over it and go through it in detail helps me get a more objective look into what needs to be fixed not only to be more visually pleasing and accessible, but also to make it more efficient for my audience to find what they need in the more efficient way.</p>
 <p>I really liked getting advice from not only my peers through the discussion, but also people who are not familiar with coding. It was great to have people who are in the same boat as me by being in this class and learning along with me give me their honest feedback because they can help me look at more of the technical side of things and give me advice on how to specifically fix it. While on the other hand the people who sought out my evaluation who are in my target audience can give me ideas on how to fix things to make it as I would say, “look pretty”. They may not be able to give me the exact same feedback as my classmates, but their opinion and insight is just as welcome to make my website the best it can be.</p>
