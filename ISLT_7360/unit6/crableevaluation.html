    <h1>Cynthia Crable's Pilot Website Evaluation Report</h1>
    <h2>Participants</h2>
    <p>Micheal Haferkamp is my neighbor who has 3 girls who attend a high school in the area. I asked him to take my survey because he would be similar to a parent that I would have during the school year. Michael is an electrician who has basic knowledge of computers and the internet. He used a Dell Inspirion with Windows 10 and Firefox as the browser.</p>
