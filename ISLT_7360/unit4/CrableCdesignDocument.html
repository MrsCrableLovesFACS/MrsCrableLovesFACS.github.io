<h1>Cynthia Crable's Design Document</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This website will be used for my students and parents within my district as well as other fellow teachers that I may or may not directly work with. I want this to be a place to get information not only about the classes I teach, but also a place of reference for everyone to see how my classroom is ran and what my expectations are. Sometimes important papers with due dates, supply lists, syllabus, etc. get lost in the shuffle so I want to include all of this important information on my website.
</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I want to include information about myself for my students, parents, peer teachers to get to know me on a more personal level. This will be on the front of my website so that it will be the very first thing that people see. This will be a great way to welcome everyone to my website and so they can see who I am.</li>
    <li>I also want to post my syllabi and/or supply lists that go with my individual classes I teach. This information will be in their own tab on the webpage. This is so that parents and students do not have to sift through all of my classes to find the information for their specific class.</li>
    <li>I also would include a calendar to help keep important dates for assignments, FCCLA and any other school dates updated. I will have a Google Calendar embedded on the website to help keep all of the important dates included. This will be on the front page of my website for quick and easy access. I can then through Google color code the classes and FCCLA to keep everything organized.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>
My target audience includes 3 major groups of people: students, parents, and peer teachers. I will individually break down my major groups  
</p>
<h4>Students</h4>
<p>
The students that will be accessing my website will range from High School Freshmen- High School Seniors. They will consist of both males and females and will be given my website address at the beginning of every semester (that is when I get new classes). The majority of my students are familiar with the internet and using computers to access websites. Some of my students may have taken a FACS class prior to my class and some have not. There are teachers who have websites at my school so some of my students may also have knowledge of how to access those websites as well.  
</p>
<h4>Parents</h4>
<p>
I do not have a specific number age range for this group. It will be adults with children who are high school age. They may also have other children who are younger or older depending on the parent. I will also have both moms and dads accessing the website and will make it available to them in my syllabus and also through a beginning of the semester welcome email from me. This will help them access my website easier. I think most parents will have some knowledge of how to work a computer and the internet since that is how we do grades, communicate, send announcements, etc. As with my students there are some teachers who have websites so having access to my website most likely will not be the first time for my parents    
</p>
<h4>Peer Teachers</h4>
<p>
This group includes teachers that I work with within my district as well as out of my district. I also will give access to all of the administrators at my school. This age range is much broader from teachers that are just getting out of college and are in their early 20s to teachers who are close to retirement around their 60s. I work with both males and females at my school and they have college degrees ranging from a bachelor’s degree all the way through PhD. Everyone will have some computer knowledge since we use computers for email communication, grades, etc. There are some teachers in my school that do run their own website and they will have more experience on what to look for on a website versus those who do not. 
</p>
<h3>5 Reference Websites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This website is a great example of a welcome page to help parents and students get to know you better as a teacher.<a href="https://www.ouachitariversd.org/113644_3"> Website 1</a> </li>
  <li>This website is a great example of how to organize the tabs at the top for different classes and topics.<a href="http://kjf42720.wixsite.com/bonappetit"> Website 2</a></li>
  <li>This website is visually pleasing but does not show a good example of how to organize a website and get the information to the audience. The tabs at the top just give information that would be found on a syllabus and so this could be condensed to one page instead of 4.<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ddmsfacs/home?authuser=0"> Website 3</a> </li>
  <li>This website is organized well and gives directions on the front page where to find information. I think this page would be easier for the audience if the tabs were all laid out at the top instead of being in a dropdown box.<a href="https://sites.google.com/Carroll.k12.in.us/nbakerfacs"> Website 4</a> </li>
  <li>I think this website gives a great representation of projects students have completed, but there are rules in place for my district that would not allow this. I think it also could have more information about the specific classes on the page to keep everyone informed.<a href="https://www.beatricepublicschools.org/vnews/display.v/SEC/Beatrice%20Middle%20School%7CTeacher%20Websites%3E%3ESmaus?template=m"> Website 5</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
<h3>Content Synopsis</h3>

<h3>Wireframe of Website Organization</h3>
<p>This is a link to my <a href="https://mrscrablelovesfacs.github.io/ISLT_7360/unit4/CrableWireFrame.pdf"> wireframe</a></p>
<h3>Rationale for Organization</h3>
<p>
  I want my webpage to be consistent throughout so I will use the same set up and similar information on each page. Each class with have their own specific information, but I will include special things to make each page a little unique and to showcase what we are doing. I also wanted to include FCCLA which is the club I sponsor. I put a lot of effort into it and it is directly related to our FACS classes so I wanted to make sure that it will also be as important on my webpage.
</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>
  On my front page I want to include a picture of myself and my husband and some pictures of my fur babies. This will be pictures that I have taken myself so that I do not infringe on any copyright laws. This will give my parents and students a visual of who I am so if they have never met me they will be able to identify me. They can also see me on a more personal level.
</p>
<p>
  I will also have pictures of projects students have completed in the different class tabs. This will not be pictures I have taken but they will not have the exact student on there, only their project. I will give credit to the student for their project with a caption but due to rules in my district I will not include pictures of the students themselves. All of my pages with pictures will have a statement saying that the images are original to the site and should not be used without permission from the site owner.  
</p>
<h3>Color Scheme and Rationale</h3>
<p>
   I want to use a color scheme that goes along with my schools’ colors Gold and black and mascot which are the Lions. This will give my website a cohesive look and a sense of pride for my students who are attending this school. I also needed colors to complement these bold colors so I chose some more neutral colors to accent them with which would be white and grey. I want my background to be Grey so that it is not over powering while the banner and headings will be gold and there will be black text inside. I can also accent the page with white boxes for information.
