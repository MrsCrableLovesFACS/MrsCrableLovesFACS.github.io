    <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This website will be used for my students and parents within my district as well as other fellow teachers that I may or may not directly work with. I want this to be a place to get information not only about the classes I teach, but also a place of reference for everyone to see how my classroom is ran and what my expectations are. Sometimes important papers with due dates, supply lists, syllabus, etc. get lost in the shuffle so I want to include all of this important information on my website.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>
My target audience includes 3 major groups of people: students, parents, and peer teachers. I will individually break down my major groups  
</p>
<h4>Students</h4>
<p>
Students: The students that will be accessing my website will range from High School Freshmen- High School Seniors. They will consist of both males and females and will be given my website address at the beginning of every semester (that is when I get new classes). The majority of my students are familiar with the internet and using computers to access websites. Some of my students may have taken a FACS class prior to my class and some have not. There are teachers who have websites at my school so some of my students may also have knowledge of how to access those websites as well.
