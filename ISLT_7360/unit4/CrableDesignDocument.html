<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This website will be used for my students and parents within my district as well as other fellow teachers that I may or may not directly work with. I want this to be a place to get information not only about the classes I teach, but also a place of reference for everyone to see how my classroom is ran and what my expectations are. Sometimes important papers with due dates, supply lists, syllabus, etc. get lost in the shuffle so I want to include all of this important information on my website.
