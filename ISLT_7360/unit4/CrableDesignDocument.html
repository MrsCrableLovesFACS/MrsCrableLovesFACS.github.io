    <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This website will be used for my students and parents within my district as well as other fellow teachers that I may or may not directly work with. I want this to be a place to get information not only about the classes I teach, but also a place of reference for everyone to see how my classroom is ran and what my expectations are. Sometimes important papers with due dates, supply lists, syllabus, etc. get lost in the shuffle so I want to include all of this important information on my website.
</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>
My target audience includes 3 major groups of people: students, parents, and peer teachers. I will individually break down my major groups  
</p>
<h4>Students</h4>
<p>
The students that will be accessing my website will range from High School Freshmen- High School Seniors. They will consist of both males and females and will be given my website address at the beginning of every semester (that is when I get new classes). The majority of my students are familiar with the internet and using computers to access websites. Some of my students may have taken a FACS class prior to my class and some have not. There are teachers who have websites at my school so some of my students may also have knowledge of how to access those websites as well.  
</p>
<h4>Parents</h4>
<p>
I do not have a specific number age range for this group. It will be adults with children who are high school age. They may also have other children who are younger or older depending on the parent. I will also have both moms and dads accessing the website and will make it available to them in my syllabus and also through a beginning of the semester welcome email from me. This will help them access my website easier. I think most parents will have some knowledge of how to work a computer and the internet since that is how we do grades, communicate, send announcements, etc. As with my students there are some teachers who have websites so having access to my website most likely will not be the first time for my parents    
</p>
<h4>Peer Teachers</h4>
<p>
This group includes teachers that I work with within my district as well as out of my district. I also will give access to all of the administrators at my school. This age range is much broader from teachers that are just getting out of college and are in their early 20s to teachers who are close to retirement around their 60s. I work with both males and females at my school and they have college degrees ranging from a bachelorâ€™s degree all the way through PhD. Everyone will have some computer knowledge since we use computers for email communication, grades, etc. There are some teachers in my school that do run their own website and they will have more experience on what to look for on a website versus those who do not. 
</p>
<h3>5+ Reference Websites</h3>
<h3>Interview Questions and Responses</h3>
<p>
I interviewed 6 people, one student, 3 parents, and 2 peer teachers, to gain more information about what to include on my website and what they would hope to see on a website ran by a teacher.

<i>Why would my website be beneficial and important for you to use?</i>
