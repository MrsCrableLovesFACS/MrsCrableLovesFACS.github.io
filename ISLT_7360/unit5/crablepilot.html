   <p>Hello! I am Mrs. Crable and I will be your teacher this semester! I am so excited to teach each and every one of you guys. Before we get too far let me tell you a little bit about myself. I have been married for 4 years to my husband, Josh, and we live locally with our 2 dogs, Bear and June, and 3 cats, Sweetheart, Hawkeye and Trapper. I graduated from the University of Central Missouri in December 2010 with my Bachelor's degree in Education, with an emphasis in Family and Consumer Sciences Education. I am currently attending Mizzou and pursuing my Master's degree in Educational Technology. In my freetime I love to spend time with my family, play with my pets anddo a variety of crafts. My favorite movie is <i>The Notebook</i> and my favorite book is <i>The Woman in Cabin 10.</i></p>
